# XY-modular-network

Investigation of phase transitions of the XY model on modular networks using Wolff Algorithm.

XY model consists of spins which can point in any direction in a plane. 

Can a new phase which has order at the modular level, but disorder at the global level exist? How does its existence depend on the modular structure of the graph?
